## Introduction
This is my first formal Kaggle competition, and the environment in the competition forum is quite different from that of completed competitions. Thanks to the help from the discussion board, I can quickly get involved at the begining. The feature engineering process from some pioneers makes a real big contribution to most competitors' kernels, and it also shows a deep understanding of the aim of this project.
My best result in private leaderboard is 0.535, which is around top 10%, but unfortunately I do not choose this as my final submission, and my result is 0.530, which drops to about top 25%.


## Description
Illuminate Learning. Ignite Possibilities.
Uncover new insights in early childhood education and how media can support learning outcomes. Participate in our fifth annual Data Science Bowl, presented by Booz Allen Hamilton and Kaggle.
PBS KIDS, a trusted name in early childhood education for decades, aims to gain insights into how media can help children learn important skills for success in school and life. In this challenge, you’ll use anonymous gameplay data, including knowledge of videos watched and games played, from the PBS KIDS Measure Up! app, a game-based learning tool developed as a part of the CPB-PBS Ready To Learn Initiative with funding from the U.S. Department of Education. Competitors will be challenged to predict scores on in-game assessments and create an algorithm that will lead to better-designed games and improved learning outcomes. Your solutions will aid in discovering important relationships between engagement with high-quality educational media and learning processes.
Data Science Bowl is the world’s largest data science competition focused on social good. Each year, this competition gives Kagglers a chance to use their passion to change the world. Over the last four years, more than 50,000+ Kagglers have submitted over 114,000+ submissions, to improve everything from lung cancer and heart disease detection to ocean health.
